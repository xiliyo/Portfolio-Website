## Description

A demo for an interactive portfolio website.

## Initial Scope VS. Final Product
### Initial Scope:
- My terms of service for my works being used.
- A gallery sorted by image size, showing samples of previous artworks I’ve done.
- A price calculator with a built in image showing the viewer what they will get for that price.
- A connection to PayPal or Kofi that would allow potential customers to pay me on the site.
- Links to my various social media pages.
- All wrapped in a red and white aesthetic, since those are the colours of my branding.

### Final Product
- The price calculator was reduced to not have an interactive image, simply because I wasn’t experienced enough with JavaScript to implement it. I also had to get it done by AI.
- Could not implement the image sort by category for the same reason.
- In general I wanted to challenge myself to try and make the website on my own, without the use of AI Co-piloting. Some aspects of the site were too difficult for me to achieve on my own though.
- Adding sound reactivity. I just could not get it to work.

## Credits

This project was co-piloted by Claude. Here's some stuff Claude helped with:

- The price calculation was entirely made by AI for my MVP.
- I reused the CSS from the price calculator container and applied it to all of the text containers ton make them look cleaner.
- I also asked my co-pilot to polish the containers for my sample artworks, and I think it made the experience cleaner by doing so. It added rounded corners and reactivity.
